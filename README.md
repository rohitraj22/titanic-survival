# Titanic Survival Analysis
---------------------------------------
## Overview
This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster.  
Through **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**, we uncover insights about how gender, class, age, fare, and embarkation port affected survival chances.  

The notebook also includes **statistical plots** and a **correlation matrix** to highlight relationships between variables.
